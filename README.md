# Kaipybara's Recipe Generator

Welcome to Kaipybara's Recipe Generator! This is a smart, web-based application that uses the power of Google's Gemini AI to turn your culinary ideas into beautiful, complete recipes. Whether you have a specific dish in mind or just a few ingredients lying around, this app is your creative partner in the kitchen.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Intelligent Recipe Generation**: The app understands your request. Ask for a specific dish like "Thanksgiving Turkey," and you'll get one classic recipe. Give it a list of ingredients like "chicken, rice, broccoli," and it will suggest up to three different creative options.
- **AI-Generated Dish Images**: Every recipe is paired with a unique, high-quality, AI-generated image of the finished dish, helping you visualize the delicious outcome.
- **Comprehensive Nutritional Info**: Each recipe card includes estimated calories per serving and a clear macronutrient breakdown (protein, carbs, and fat) with a visual bar chart.
- **Fully Multilingual**: The app automatically detects the language of your input and generates the entire recipe‚Äîincluding all the labels like "Ingredients" and "Prep Time"‚Äîin that same language.
- **Interactive & Responsive UI**: Browse multiple recipe options with a sleek, intuitive "fan stack" carousel. The entire interface is fully responsive and looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **Save & Share**: With a single click, you can download the currently displayed recipe card as a high-quality PNG image, perfect for saving or sharing with friends and family.

## üöÄ How to Use

Using the generator is simple:

1.  **Enter Your Request**: In the input box, type what you want to cook. This can be:
    *   A specific dish (e.g., `Classic Beef Lasagna`, `Tarte Tatin`)
